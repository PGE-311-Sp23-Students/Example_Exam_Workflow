Welcome to your Midterm Exam 1 repository! Please read this Readme file in its entirety before starting your exam.


## Before you begin
A workflow will provide you with a personalized version of this exam. You will need to manually run this workflow before you begin.

1) From your repository landing page, go to the "Actions" tab
2) On the left panel, select the ".github/workflows/main.yml" workflow
3) Open the "Run workflow" dropdown menu
4) Click the green "Run workflow" button

	title="Run Workflow" width="800" />

Please wait a moment before proceeding — continue refreshing the page until you see a green checkmark, similar to homework 2. The commit message of the exam template should change from "Initial commit" to "Created personalized exam and data file." You should also see an additional data file title "acoustic.txt". This should only take about 1-2 minutes. If you have trouble with any of this, please email Dr. P or one of the TAs. We will manually send you a copy of the exam.

## After running the workflow

Download the repository to your computer and complete the provided exam template ([PGE310_F21_Exam1A.ipynb](PGE310_F21_Exam_1A.ipynb)). All required files are provided in this repository. **Please include all of your solutions in the provided template and do not change the name of this file on your submission.**

You will have 2 hours to complete this exam. This exam is open note — you are allowed to consult the course lectures, solved homework, and official module/library documentation (e.g., https://numpy.org/). **You are not allowed to consult any other person or other online resources.**

Once you are finished, submit copies of your completed Jupyter Notebook exam template to this repository and to Canvas.

Good luck!
